# Micron OS: the road off the distro

The honest long game. Micron OS runs on a Linux base (Ubuntu today) the same
way every self-made OS does — SteamOS on Arch, Raspberry Pi OS on Debian,
Android on the bare kernel. "Its own OS" is earned by identity, behaviour,
and experience, not by rewriting plumbing. This is the staged plan to own
more of the body over time until almost nothing general-purpose is left.

The rule for every stage: **we peel each layer from a working machine.** You
are never staring at a black screen wondering why nothing boots. Every stage
is usable on its own, and every stage is a real, visible gain in ownership.

---

## Stage 0 — Alfred is the machine's purpose   (TONIGHT)
Install Ubuntu 24.04 alongside Windows; clone the repo; core + sudo + harden.
Power on, and Micron OS is there at localhost:8710, run by a butler who does
not know your name yet.
- Buys: the whole system, running on real hardware, for the first time.
- Effort: one evening.

## Stage 1 — Boots into Micron OS, no Ubuntu in sight   (weeks, not years)
The machine boots the kernel and a minimal session that launches straight
into the Micron OS shell — no GNOME, no Ubuntu desktop ever drawn. Plymouth
boot splash with your emblem; GRUB themed. Kiosk session selectable at login.
- Buys: to your eyes and anyone else's, the machine IS Micron OS from
  power-on. This is the single biggest leap in feel, and it is close.
- Effort: a few focused weekends. Cage/greetd or a GNOME kiosk session,
  a Plymouth theme, a GRUB theme.

## Stage 2 — Your own install image   (IN PROGRESS — deploy/image/, docs/IMAGE.md)
An Ubuntu autoinstall / preseed ISO that lays the whole system down
unattended: partition, base, Ollama, the repo, the services — one USB, no
manual steps. "Installing Micron OS" becomes a single image on any machine.
- Buys: the honest version of "my own OS on a disc." Reproducible, portable,
  yours to hand to another machine.
- Effort: learn autoinstall YAML; iterate in a VM until one USB does it all.

## Stage 3 — Thin the body   (the start of really owning it)
Strip the base to only what Micron OS uses. Remove the general-purpose
desktop stack, the apps you never call, the services you do not run. Replace
Ubuntu's init choices with your own where it helps. What remains is a system
whose every running part earns its place.
- Buys: a smaller attack surface, a faster boot, and a base you understand
  end to end because you chose each piece.
- Effort: incremental and ongoing; measure, remove, verify it still boots,
  repeat.

## Stage 4 — Swap the base off Ubuntu   (the real "getting rid of Ubuntu")
Move from Ubuntu to a minimal base you assemble yourself: Debian's core,
Alpine, or a Buildroot/Yocto image where you pick every package that goes in.
Micron OS's shell, services, and Alfred move across unchanged — they were
never Ubuntu-specific. At the end, no Ubuntu remains.
- Buys: the thing you asked for. Nobody would call this Ubuntu, because none
  of Ubuntu is left. This is genuinely achievable in a couple of years of
  side work; embedded-Linux products are built exactly this way.
- Effort: real, but bounded. The hard part is packaging discipline, not
  invention.

## The portability rule  (binding, from Aug 2026)

Everything built for Micron OS must run on ANY Linux base, so that leaving
Ubuntu is an update, not a rewrite. Concretely:

- **Alfred, the shell, the apps, the bus, memory, security — all of it — may
  never depend on Ubuntu specifically.** Pure Python, plain HTML, standard
  Linux interfaces only. (Audited Aug 2026: this already holds.)
- **Base-specific code is quarantined in `deploy/` and nowhere else.** As of
  tonight, Ubuntu is touched in exactly three places, all in deploy: apt
  package commands, the GNOME autostart kiosk, and gdm auto-login. Swapping
  the base means rewriting only those — a page of shell script, not the OS.
- **Every new feature is judged against this rule before it ships.** If a
  build reaches for something Ubuntu-only, it either goes through deploy/ as
  a swappable adapter, or it does not go in.

This is what "framing everything so we can get rid of Ubuntu" means in
practice: the exit stays one small directory wide, forever.

## The one line we do not cross — and why it is right
The Linux **kernel** stays. Writing a kernel, or drivers for your specific
GPU and WiFi, is a career, not a side project, and it buys fragility where
the kernel already gives you rock-solid hardware support for free. Keeping it
does not make Micron OS "not yours": Android, ChromeOS, SteamOS, every router
and smart TV keep the Linux kernel and are unmistakably their own. The kernel
is a component — like the steel a car's frame is made from. You do not forge
your own steel to have built your own car.

## Where this ends
Your emblem at boot. Your init bringing up your services. A base you
assembled package by package. The Micron OS shell as the whole machine.
Alfred running all of it, knowing you by the name he learned. And underneath,
the Linux kernel doing the one job it would be madness to rewrite.

That is your operating system. The plan gets you there one usable machine at
a time — and tonight is Stage 0.
